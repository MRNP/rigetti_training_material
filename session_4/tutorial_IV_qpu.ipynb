Decoherence can be loosely interpreted as loss of the quantum information in the qubit, and is caused by imperfections in the implementations of the quantum gates, or due to simple time-evolution of the system, as any current quantum chip is necessarily an open quantum system to a certain degree.\n",

Without any noise, you would expect the state to be $\\ket{0}$ again (remember $H^2 = I$), but if something caused the qubit to decohere to either $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$ in the meantime, you will obtain the $\\frac{\\ket{0}\\pm\\ket{1}}{\\sqrt{2}}$ instead.\n"
